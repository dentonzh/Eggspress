External links take your readers to places near and far on the Internet.

![](my_posts/reference/images/paper_airplaneworld.jpg)

## Creating external links
The easiest way to create an external link in Eggspress is to use Markdown syntax:

`[]()`

1. Write your link text between the square brackets
2. Write your URL between the parentheses

Examples:
1. `[find online courses](https://opencourser.com)`
2. `Here's a site where you can [watch videos and take quizzes](https://quizbi.com)`

Eggspress requires that you provide a protocol (e.g. `https://`). If you omit this, Eggspress may treat your external link as an internal link. This may result in a broken or invisible link.
## External link behavior
External links behave a bit differently from [internal links](/blog/linking-internal-content). The most noticeable difference is that external links open in a new tab whereas internal links do not.

If you are linking to other pages or content on your Eggspress site, we strongly recommend [using internal links](/blog/linking-internal-content).
