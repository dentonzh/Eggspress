Eggspress is a lightweight blogging platform built on Next.js and React. It's designed to help anyone launch a new website with little to no coding experience. There's no command line needed. Best of all, it's lightning fast and completely free![^1]

## Why Eggspress?
Eggspress is a great place to start a new site. It's lightweight and nimble, providing your readers with a snappy experience. Pages load very quickly even on slower connections. It's also free, making use of Github and Vercel's generous free tier.

Out of the box, Eggspress provides core features that cover most authors' needs. This means you can easily extend Eggspress' open-source code to build new features and connect to other services.

When you use Eggspress, your content belongs to you. You're free to host your site wherever you wish. Eggspress also uses Github-flavored Markdown, a widely used format for storing your pages. If you ever feel that it's time to move to another blogging platform, just move your files!

Of course, if you use Eggspress, we'd love for you to stay. If you have feedback or suggestions, [create an issue](https://github.com/dentonzh/Eggspress/issues/new) with your comments or email your thoughts to eggspressblog [at] gmail.

### Why not Eggspress?
Eggspress is a new platform. As a result, it doesn't have the same breadth of plugins, themes, and tools made for it. If you need more bells and whistles than what Eggspress offers, you may want to look elsewhere.

Because it's "CMS-less," Eggspress lacks a sleek interface for managing your site. Every setting and every bit of content you change on Eggspress is done by modifying a file or creating a new file.

For the best possible experience, we recommend setting up and publishing to Eggspress using a computer.
