Keys prefixed with "color" allow you to define the color scheme of your Eggspress blog. Eggspress uses Tailwind, which includes and expansive set of colors to select from. Color shades for these options are limited to 50, 100, 200, 800, 900, and 950. The color "white" is also available without color shades. We recommend choosing 50, 100, and 200 for light mode and 800, 900, and 950 colors for dark mode.
