This is a brand new Eggspress site! Come back soon for more content on this page.


**If you're the author:**

You can find this page in `my_pages` as `about.md`. In the frontmatter, you'll notice that there is this field, `sidebar: "eggspress-links"`. This means that this page should display a sidebar with data stored in `my_sidebars/eggspress_links.md`.

Below the sidebar key is an entry `weight: 50`. The higher the weight, the lower this page will appear in a list of pages. If you create a new page with `weight: 20` for example, that new page will appear above this page. Heavier weights sink lower.
