Notes on frontmatter:
- All fields are optional
- If name is left empty, the author's name will appear as the filename of the profile without its extension (.md, typically)

The `orderPostsBy` and `orderPostsByReversed` keys allow you to set how posts are sorted when viewing this particular author's page. If these are left blank or you remove these keys, sorting will be determined by keys in the `my_settings/appearance.md`:

```
orderPostsInAuthorsBy: "date"
orderPostsInAuthorsByReversed: false
```

By default, authors themselves appear in alphabetical order in the Footer of this site. You can modify this sorting behavior in `my_settings/appearance.md` and changing `orderAuthorsBy` to `"weight`". You can then adjust the `"weight"` keys on each of the files in `my_authors` manually.

```
orderAuthorsBy: "alphabetical"
orderAuthorsByReversed: false
```
