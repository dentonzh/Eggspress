### Why Use Markdown?

Here are some key benefits of writing in markdown[^1]:

- **Easy to read/write** - The simple plaintext formatting helps content stay readable and accessible. Much better than heavy syntax or code.
- **Fast formatting** - You can style posts incredibly quickly with just a few keystrokes. 
- **Version control friendly** - Markdown plays nicely with tools like Git, allowing cleaner diffs between versions.
- **Future proof** - If you ever migrate your site away from Eggspress, the markdown will port over seamlessly. 
- **Wide device support** - Markdown is interpreted easily across all devices and screens.
