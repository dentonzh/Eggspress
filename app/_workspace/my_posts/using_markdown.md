## Getting Started with Markdown

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax that converts plain text into HTML elements. It allows you to style posts with headers, lists, links, and more without needing to write clunky HTML tags.

## Why Use Markdown?

Here are some key benefits of writing in markdown[^1]:

- **Easy to read/write** - The simple plaintext formatting helps content stay readable and accessible. Much better than heavy syntax or code.
- **Fast formatting** - You can style posts incredibly quickly with just a few keystrokes. 
- **Version control friendly** - Markdown plays nicely with tools like Git, allowing cleaner diffs between versions.
- **Future proof** - If you ever migrate your site away from Eggspress, the markdown will port over seamlessly. 
- **Wide device support** - Markdown is interpreted easily across all devices and screens.  

## Examples
If you're reading this page on your new site, then what you see below is the final output of various Markdown syntax. To see the raw Markdown syntax itself, take a peek at the file titled `using_markdown.md` in your `my_posts` folder.
