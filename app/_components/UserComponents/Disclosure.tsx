How to use this custom component:

Add this file to the `my_components` folder of your workspace.
You may use this component at any point by inserting the following directly into your content:

    <Disclosure />


This custom component accepts two optional properties:

    1. text
    2. page
    3. link-text


The property `text` allows you to replace the default text with your own text.
The property `page` allows you to provide a link to a custom page on your site (for example, "disclosure")
The property `linkText` allows you to provide a custom label for the page link specified in property `page`

One example of how you may apply these properties is as follows:

    <Disclosure text="Please consult with your physician before following the advice on this page" page="medical-disclosure" link-text="Learn more" />


You may also customize this component using React, Next.js, and Tailwind. It is recommended that you keep custom components self-contained within one file where possible.
